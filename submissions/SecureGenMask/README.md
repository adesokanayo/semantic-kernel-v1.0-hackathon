# SecureGenMask

SecureGenMask is a powerful solution designed to enhance data privacy and security in the realm of Language Model (LM) interactions. Developed for the [Hackathon Name], this innovative project focuses on preventing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and sensitive data from being transmitted to Language Models.

## Key Features

- **Regular Expression Magic**: SecureGenMask employs sophisticated Regular Expressions to intelligently identify and remove any PII from data before it reaches Language Models.
- **Seamless Integration with Semantic Kernel**: Leveraging the hook events of the Semantic Kernel, our solution seamlessly integrates into the workflow, ensuring robust protection without compromising performance.

## Why SecureGenMask?

- **Enterprise-Grade Security**: Tailored for enterprise use cases, SecureGenMask addresses the critical need for heightened security when dealing with customer information, GDPR compliance, and privacy concerns related to AI.
- **Effortless Implementation**: With a user-friendly design, SecureGenMask can be effortlessly integrated into existing systems, minimizing the learning curve for developers.
- **Performance Optimized**: Our solution prioritizes performance without sacrificing security, ensuring a smooth and efficient experience in handling sensitive data.

## How It Works

1. **Data Ingress**: SecureGenMask intercepts data before it is transmitted to Language Models.
2. **Regular Expression Filtering**: PII and sensitive data are meticulously identified and removed using advanced Regular Expressions.
3. **Secure Transmission**: Cleaned data is then securely transmitted to Language Models, preventing any inadvertent exposure of confidential information.
4. **Optional Integration to Azure AI Service - This uses the PII detection capability of Azure AI.
5. * Use as a Plugin or Use as a standalone native function. 

## Use Cases

- **Customer Information Protection**: Safeguarding customer data is paramount. SecureGenMask ensures that no sensitive information is compromised during AI interactions.
- **GDPR Compliance**: With increasing regulatory scrutiny, SecureGenMask aids organizations in complying with GDPR requirements by preventing unauthorized exposure of personal data.
